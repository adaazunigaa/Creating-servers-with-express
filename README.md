## Libraries vs Frameworks
    LIBRARY
    -  When you use a library, you are in  charge. You control the flow of the application code, and you decide when to use the library. 

    FRAMEWORK
    -With frameworks, that control is inverted. The framework is in charge, and you are merely aparticipant! The framework tells you where to plug in the code.
